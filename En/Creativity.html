										<h3>Road Bikes and Aerodynamic Drags</h3>

										<p>The biggest resistance when riding a road bike is air drag. Therefore, when we ride in a group, we take turns to work as a wind shield and try to reduce the overall aerodynamic drag (the leader in the photo is me at work pulling the front of the group).
											Nowadays, bicycle manufacturers are making great efforts to reduce aerodynamic drag by every single possible 1w.
										</p>
										<p>
											There are several ways to reduce aerodynamic drag, one of them is to put the wires needed for braking and shifting inside the frame. However, such high-spec bicycles are very expensive, and for owners who already have old bicycles, there was no way to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the wires.
											I studied mechanical engineering and fluid dynamics at Tokyo Institute of Technology, and learned how to use simulation tools. I used this knowledge to develop a aerodynamic part to reduce the drag of wires.
										</p>
		　　　　　　　　　

										<h3>Development of Aero-Cover for brake wires</h3>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/mounted2.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										<p>
											The idea is simple. After using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) to find the optimum shape, I asked a local factory to make a prototype from silicon.
											In addition, I developed a small wind tunnel by myselves and verified whether the aerodynamic drag was actually reduced by installing the cover.
											The wind tunnel, which was calibrated using data from a previous study, proved that the aerocover did indeed reduce drag.
										</p>
										<p>
											After prototyping the parts, they proposed the idea to several companies.
											Unfortunately, the idea was not adopted because the number of rim-brake bicycles with cables outside of their frames will decrease as disc brakes become more popular.
											However it was a good experience for me to go through the whole process from planning to proposal by myself.
										</p>

											<h3>1w (watt) makes the difference between winning and losing.</h3>

												<p>The difference between second and third place in the individual time trial at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was only 4.3 seconds. This means there was a difference in average power output of 1.2w between them. If he had been able to cut 1.2w by their equipment, they could have brought home better color medals at the Olympics.

											<p>Is a result of simulations trustworthy?</h3>
											<p>Although simulation seems to be perfect, there are various factors that affect its accuracy. Therefore, CFDs are equipped with a variety of options, which must be set appropriately and the results must be verified.</p>
											<span href="#" class="image fit"><img src="../images/wing2.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>In this development, the k-ω model of RANS was initially used for the simulation. However, this method has a disadvantage that it is not accurate near the wall at the calculation. Therefore the result was very different compared with the actual experimental value of the aerodynamic drag coefficient of the cylinder.
												Hence I adopted the SST k-ω method, which brings relatvely good results near the wall. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of the cylinder calculated by this method was close enough to the experiment and suitable for the development of the part.

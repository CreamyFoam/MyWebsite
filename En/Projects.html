											<h3>Detecting sluice gates using machine learning</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="../images/Schleuse1.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												This project aims to apply machine learning to real raw data, rather than data for standard training such as MNIST.
											<p>
											 In our group, we obtained radar measurement data of ships passing through the sluice gate from a company where our group members did internship. We applied machine learning to these data.
											 The measurement data of the sluice gate is shown in the upper right. It is impossible to determine which measurement point is located pm the movable part (gate), side wall, and other parts of the sluice gate.
											 Our model was trained to automatically determine them.

											<h3>Development of an interface between finite element method and a machine learning framework</h3>
											<p>
												We developed an interface between FEniCS, a finite element method framework that allows direct input of governing equations, and PyTorch, a machine learning framework. Neural network are used to predict unknown terms.

											<h3>Development of a Flight Control Program using Reinforcement Learning</h3>
											<span href="#" class="image fit"><img src="../images/EasyModel.gif" alt="" /></span>
											<p>
												A flight control program was developed using reinforcement learning to avoid obstacles and pass the destinations.
												In order to reduce the learning time significantly, a two-stage method was used, in which training was performed on a simple simulation model and later adapted to a complex real-world model.

											<h3>Fully automatic beer server</h3>
											<p>
												In this project, my group built a "fully automatic beer server" under the theme of "a recreational robot".
												I was the group leader and in charge of electrical circuit and programming.
												Seeing tells much more than reading, so have a look at the video below.

											<h3>Development of Aero-Cover for Road Bike</h3>
											<p>
												More than 80 percent of a bicycle's resistance is aerodynamic drag.
												On today's high-end road bikes, the cables and wires that create aerodynamic drag are stored inside the frame.
												However, you can't store the cables in the frame you already own, which often leaves you far behind other riders in terms of equipment.
												Therefore, I developed a aero-cover to reduce the aerodynamic drag of these cables through CFD and wind tunnel testing.

											<h3>Analysis of MILD Combustion Field</h3>
											<p>
												As more efficient and environmentally friendly combustors are required, MILD combustion is one of the promising solutions.
												MILD combustion is characterized by a wide range and complex shape of chemical reactions, which makes the development of combustors using this combustion mode difficult.
												In order to simulate a combustor with MILD combustion easily, a highly accurate model of MILD combustion is required.
												A basic study to create such a model was carried out.
												This research was also published as a chapter in a paper.
